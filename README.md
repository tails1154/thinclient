# thinclient

internet proxy thing



## if you want security, this isnt the place to go lol

but if you don't care for some reason

just copy all the files in this dir to /tailsnet on a webserver and update all the references to 192.168.0.107 to your ip (or just ask ai or something to make a command to change it all for you lol)



You also need a user named tails1154 and all the 'thin' folder files to be in it or again just chamge all the references to /home/tails1154 to /home/<yourusername> or whatever path you want it to be


copy the thin folder to the thin client and find a million deps that need to be installed.



## proxy

You will need to go to mitm.it and get the CA cert and install it on the thin client for https sites to work
